# How did humans evolve?

The Song lab uses a genetics and genomics lens to understand how humans evolved. We apply a wide range of experimental and computational approaches from diverse fields, including: evolutionary biology, molecular biology, developmental biology, anthropology, functional genomics, comparative genomics, cell culture models, animal models, genome engineering, and machine learning. We focus on understanding how human-specific sequence changes result in neural specializations and ultimately impact cognition, social behavior, and motor control. 

#### What genetic variants between humans and chimpanzees contribute to human-specific traits?

#### How do human-evolved genomic regions affect diseases of cognition and social behavior?

#### How does genetic variation in modern humans affect normal and disease trait variation?
