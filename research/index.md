# How did humans evolve?

The Song lab applies a genetics and genomics lens to understand how humans evolved. We focus on understanding how human-specific sequence changes result in neural specializations and ultimately impact cognition, social behavior, and motor control. 

We use a wide range of experimental and computational approaches from diverse fields, including: evolutionary biology, molecular biology, developmental biology, anthropology, functional genomics, comparative genomics, cell culture models, animal models, human cohorts, genome engineering, and machine learning. 

#### What genetic variants contribute to human-specific traits?

#### How does human evolution affect human disease?

#### How does genetic variation in modern humans influence normal and disease trait variation?
